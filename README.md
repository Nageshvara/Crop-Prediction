In this website we try to predict the suitable crop based on the soil type , temperature , humidity and rainfall. To identify these we only get the district name , state name , target month and the soil type from the user . Then using openweathermap.api we identify the live weather conditions of the district entered by the user , by uaing this we identify the temperature and humidity of the area . Then by using the target month and the city name we identify the annual rainfall of that city . Then we identify the PH of the soil type given by the user. By knowing all these details and using the required datasets we use the Randomforest Classifier algorithm to predict the required crop and we also tell the market details for the predicted crop to help the user.
